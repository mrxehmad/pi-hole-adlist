## 📋 List Format

All lists follow the standard Pi-hole format:

- Each line contains an IP address (usually `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1`) followed by a domain
- Lines starting with `#` are comments and will be ignored
- Some lists include wildcard patterns using `||domain.com^` format

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Testing**: Some domains may block legitimate functionality. Test thoroughly in your environment.
- **Update Frequency**: Lists are updated periodically as new tracking domains are discovered.
- **False Positives**: If you find a domain that blocks legitimate content, please [report an issue](https://github.com/mrxehmad/pi-hole-adlist/issues).
- **Backup**: Always backup your Pi-hole configuration before adding new lists.
