## huawei-block-list

It's a block list. You can integrate this into your PiHole or local blocking software such as Blokada, AdAway... etc. to block out all the outgoing connections to the said domains.

It turns out, if your device has bloated softwares(ie. Apps that comes pre-installed and you can't remove them unless you root your device, you're forced into keeping those services running. Manufacturers like Huawei have stopped providing bootloader unlock codes thereby not allowing you to root your device. So, the best solution is to setup a local proxy server that blocks the connection.

1. Log in to your Pi-hole admin interface.
2. Select the "Adlists" tab.
3. Enter the URL of the list you want to add.
